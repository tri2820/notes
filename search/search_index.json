The rest is mostly your team compatibility, personalities, critical thinking skills and story telling ability. Nevertheless, I want to share 2 pitch decks, during my time as a startup co-founder at Antler.</p> <p>3 months into Antler Founder program and you would have an event called IC, where you would meet the Investment Committees (around 6 people) to raise your very first pre-seed funding ($110K for 12%).</p> <p>2 weeks before IC you would have the pre-IC event, where you do a mock presentation and receive feedback from your coaches.</p> <p>This one did not pass Pre-IC:</p> <p>Antler VN 3 - Zen - Pre IC pitch deck.pdf</p> <p>I received no feedback on the slides, or rather I did not ask my coach for it, because the reason we failed is more of the team formation and the way we presented. I can say for definite that this was the most terrible, horrifying presentation in the history of pitching.</p> <p>After failing the Pre-IC, I got a message inviting me to join another team as CTO. We (new team) pivoted a lot, technically. We asked if it would be wise to perform an actual demo or to include a demo video and people said no. Figured.</p> <p>This one passed IC:</p> <p>Antler VN 3 - Rayo - IC pitch deck.pdf</p> <p>We over-prepared this one, as it should be. We did not go into the appendix but just leave it there in case the committees ask any question. </p> <p>I presented the first half. Watched some Youtube video about story-telling tricks and I can say it improved the flow of the presentation a lot. Unfortunately they are all verbal so you cannot see from the PDF files. I remembered hinting \"Blind users spent XX minutes to learn how to use a new website\" at slide 2 and 10 slides later \"Now with this they only need a few second\". BAM. Value propositions for you.</p> <p>So there you go. I probably will not advertise this blog anywhere, so if you somehow stumble upon this because you searched for it, good luck with your fund raise!</p>"},{"location":"Only%20data%20scientists%20love%20Jupyter%20Notebooks/","title":"Only data scientists love Jupyter Notebooks","text":"<p>Bar of entry for notebooks is low because it looks like a research paper.</p> <ul> <li>Markdown comment</li> <li>Code</li> <li>Plot</li> </ul> <p>Other mediums vowed to replace it, but would have a hard time explaining what they are:</p> <ul> <li>Postman Flows</li> <li>VizierDB</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Only%20data%20scientists%20love%20Jupyter%20Notebooks/#praise","title":"Praise","text":"<p>Make code more tangible (output is directly under)</p>"},{"location":"Only%20data%20scientists%20love%20Jupyter%20Notebooks/#criticism","title":"Criticism","text":"<p>Check I Don't Like Notebooks.</p> <ul> <li>Hidden state</li> <li>Requirement management is bad</li> <li>Hard-coded path &amp; constants everywhere</li> </ul> <p>Why don't we just use code?</p> <ul> <li>No inline plot</li> <li>Sharing is hard</li> <li>Reading is usually not top-down</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Only%20data%20scientists%20love%20Jupyter%20Notebooks/#a-hot-mess-it-is","title":"A Hot Mess It Is","text":"<p>Set aside the lack of features like autocomplete, the fundamental problem is using the same tools for multiple (inseparable) tasks</p> <ul> <li>For education (researching papers, books, etc)</li> <li>For exploring datasets and ideas</li> <li>For software development: Netflix replaces bash script with notebooks</li> </ul> <p>These tasks deceptively start the same: with writing some code.
