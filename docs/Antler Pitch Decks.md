A pitch deck contributes somewhere around 10% to whether you are invested or not. The rest is mostly your team compatibility, personalities, critical thinking skills and story telling ability. Nevertheless, I want to share 2 pitch decks, during my time as a startup co-founder at Antler.

3 months into [Antler Founder program](https://www.antler.co/location/vietnam) and you would have an event called IC, where you would meet the Investment Committees (around 6 people) to raise your very first pre-seed funding ($110K for 12%).

2 weeks before IC you would have the pre-IC event, where you would do a mock presentation and receive feedback from your coaches.

This one did *not* pass Pre-IC:

I received no feedback on the slides, or rather I did not ask my coach for it, because the reason we failed is more of the team formation and the way we presented. I can say for definite that this was the most terrible, horrifying presentation in the history of pitching.

After failing the Pre-IC, I got a message inviting me to join another team as CTO. We (new team) pivoted a lot, technically. We asked if it would be wise to perform an actual demo or to include a demo video and people said no. Figured.

We over-prepared this one, as it should be. We did not go into the appendix but just leave it there in case the committees ask any question. 

I presented the first half. Watched some Youtube video about story-telling tricks and I can say it improved the flow of the presentation a lot. Unfortunately they are all verbal so you cannot see from the PDF files. I remembered hinting "Blind users spent XX minutes to learn how to use a new website" at slide 2 and 10 slides later "Now with this they only need a few second". BAM. Value propositions for you.

So there you go. I probably will not advertise this blog anywhere, so if you somehow stumble upon this because you searched for it, good luck with your fund raise!

Anyway after my part ended, one of the IC members stared at me for 2 minutes non-stop. For some reason I tried not to break eye-contact but eventually did in the end. Fun but scary memory though. Think I got judged.
